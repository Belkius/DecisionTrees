# Exploration of Decision Trees

## What is a Decision Tree?
Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in recursively manner call recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps in decision making. It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions. It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.
